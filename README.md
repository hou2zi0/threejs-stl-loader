# threejs-stl-loader

This repository contains a very basic STL loader with controlls and some toon shaders. It is intended as a kind of sandbox in order to approach three.js.

The repo, however, may contain some interesting sections:
* the toon shader implementation
* the STL-loader
* the raycaster (used to generate on click events)

After installing the dependencies via npm, the dev server may be startet with `npm run start`.
